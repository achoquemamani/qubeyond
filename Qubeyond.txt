Questions

1. What's a closure? Where in the code is there a closure?

It's a function which can access to the variable outside of its scope and it creates in execution time.
I use the closure in unit test and in the component PlanetTable.vue.

2. Which are the potential side-effects in any function? Could you point out any of these cases in your code? Are they expected? Can they be avoided?

Side effects in functions refer to changes in the state of the program that occur outside the scope of the function. They may include modifying a global variable, modifying a parameter passed by reference, or any other action that affects the state of the program.
I use it when I assign the data for showing planets. In this particular case, it is expected result.
